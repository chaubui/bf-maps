# bf-maps
Use output generated from BEAST and SPREAD3 to map highly supported routes of spread in R. While SPREAD3 already creates a map for you,  this code here creates a "prettier" map which can be customized. It displays only highly supported routes, on a multi-coloured map. It uses the Bayes Factor table generated from SPREAD3, as well as location coordinate data (use the same one that you used in SPREAD3), a country map (which can be downloaded from gadm.org), and a table of location groups (my country maps had too many administrative regions, so I needed to group administrative regions together to make the maps less "messy"). 

# SPREAD3
You will need to first obtain the Bayes Factor table from SPREAD 3
